Position will vary (for now you have in the trainer LJ / HJ / CO / BU / SB only for 40BB deep)

# USE THE TRAINER FOR YOUR OWN RANGE
Currently you need to change a bit of code to add your own range to the trainer, it will come in further version.
To implement your own range you need to modify this :

# What need to be done in the futur
* Customize the code to implement personnal range to the trainer
* Update the trainer to train to a specific range
* Not everything is in english
* A bit ugly right now, it could be more cool with some color or with something else than tkinter.
* More things to improve in the code, lot of it was writted with chatgpt
